# Password-generator
This is the code for a basic Random password generator.  The HTML and CSS have been used to create a very simple layout with a button and placeholder for the generated password.  The javacript is built to prompt the user with a series of yes/no questions for determining the criteria to make the password with.  Once the criteria has been input, a password will be generated based off of that criteria.
